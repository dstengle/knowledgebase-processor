# Sub-Task: Consolidate Extracted ADR Decisions

**Goal:**
Consolidate the extracted ADR decisions from the input JSON file into a single, well-formatted Markdown file. This file will serve as a concise summary of architectural decisions for developers.

**Input:**
- JSON file path from previous step: [`{{workspace}}/.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_consolidate_adrs_for_devs_S002/artifacts/rooroo-documenter/extracted_decisions.json`](../ROO#SUB_consolidate_adrs_for_devs_S002/artifacts/rooroo-documenter/extracted_decisions.json)
  (This file contains a JSON object mapping ADR file paths to their "Decision" section content.)

**Output:**
- A Markdown file named `consolidated_adr_summary.md` located in the `{{workspace}}/docs/architecture/` directory.
- The file should be structured as follows:
    - Main Title (e.g., `# Consolidated Architectural Decision Records Summary`)
    - Brief introduction explaining the purpose of the document.
    - For each ADR decision in the input JSON:
        - A sub-heading derived from the ADR filename (e.g., `## ADR-0001: Python as Implementation Language`)
        - The extracted decision content.
- Ensure the output is well-formatted and easy for developers to read.

**Artifact Output:**
- Also, save a copy of the generated `consolidated_adr_summary.md` to your task's artifact directory: `{{workspace}}/.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_consolidate_adrs_for_devs_S003/artifacts/rooroo-documenter/consolidated_adr_summary.md`
