# Task Briefing: Consolidate ADRs for Developer Implementation

**User Request:**
"Make a consolidated version of the ADRs with only the pertinent information for implementation so that the developer has concise instructions to follow with respect to architecture decisions. This file will be overwritten over time with a new consolidated view as new ADRs are added."

**Relevant Files (ADRs):**
- [`docs/architecture/decisions/0000-adr-template.md`](docs/architecture/decisions/0000-adr-template.md)
- [`docs/architecture/decisions/0001-python-as-implementation-language.md`](docs/architecture/decisions/0001-python-as-implementation-language.md)
- [`docs/architecture/decisions/0002-pydantic-for-data-models.md`](docs/architecture/decisions/0002-pydantic-for-data-models.md)
- [`docs/architecture/decisions/0003-pydantic-model-versioning-strategy.md`](docs/architecture/decisions/0003-pydantic-model-versioning-strategy.md)
- [`docs/architecture/decisions/0004-package-structure.md`](docs/architecture/decisions/0004-package-structure.md)
- [`docs/architecture/decisions/0005-poetry-as-package-manager.md`](docs/architecture/decisions/0005-poetry-as-package-manager.md)

**Goal:**
Create a single Markdown file (e.g., `docs/architecture/consolidated_adr_summary.md`) that synthesizes the key decisions and implementation guidance from all ADRs. The focus should be on information directly useful to developers. This file will be a living document, updated as new ADRs are introduced.

**Considerations for Planner:**
-   The planner should define steps to:
    1.  Identify all ADR files in the [`docs/architecture/decisions/`](docs/architecture/decisions/) directory.
    2.  For each ADR, extract only the "## Decision" section.
    3.  Consolidate this extracted information into a new Markdown file.
    4.  The output file should be well-formatted and easy for developers to read.
    5.  The process should be repeatable for future updates.
-   Suggest an appropriate expert (likely `rooroo-documenter` or `rooroo-developer` if code interaction is needed, though `rooroo-documenter` seems more fitting for summarizing text).
