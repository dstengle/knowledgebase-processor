# Knowledge Base Processor Documentation Approach

## Overview

This document summarizes the documentation approach for the Knowledge Base Processor project. The documentation is structured to support iterative development while maintaining a clear record of architectural decisions and system evolution.

## Key Documentation Elements

### 1. Architectural Principles

The [architectural principles](architecture/principles/README.md) document establishes the core values that guide design decisions:

- **Simplicity Over Complexity**: Prioritizing straightforward designs appropriate for personal use
- **Pragmatic Metadata Extraction**: Focusing on metadata that provides immediate, practical value
- **Iterative Enhancement**: Building the system incrementally with each iteration providing value
- **Personal Workflow Integration**: Ensuring smooth integration with personal knowledge management
- **Maintainability**: Designing for ease of future modifications and minimal technical debt

### 2. System Context

The [system context](architecture/system-overview/context.md) document defines:

- The purpose of the Knowledge Base Processor
- System boundaries (what it is and isn't)
- External systems it interacts with
- Key interactions and data flows
- Constraints and success criteria

### 3. Component Architecture

The [components document](architecture/system-overview/components.md) outlines:

- Major system components and their responsibilities
- Component interactions and relationships
- Design considerations including modularity and extensibility
- Implementation guidance for each component

### 4. Data Flow

The [data flow document](architecture/system-overview/data-flow.md) describes:

- How data moves through the system
- Transformations applied at each stage
- Data models for content and metadata
- Performance and storage considerations

### 5. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

The [ADR template](architecture/decisions/0000-adr-template.md) provides a structure for documenting key decisions:

- Context and problem statement
- Decision details
- Rationale and alternatives considered
- Consequences and related decisions

### 6. Feature Specifications

The [feature template](features/feature-template.md) establishes a consistent format for documenting features:

- Feature summary and motivation
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Technical implementation details
- Dependencies and limitations

A sample feature specification for [Markdown Structure Extraction](features/planned/markdown-structure-extraction.md) demonstrates the template in use.

### 7. Evolution Roadmap

The [evolution plan](architecture/roadmap/evolution-plan.md) outlines the phased development approach:

- **Phase 1**: Structural & Content Extraction
- **Phase 2**: Semantic & Contextual Analysis
- **Phase 3**: Integration & Representation
- **Phase 4**: Refinement & Extension

## Documentation Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Documentation is organized from high-level concepts to detailed specifications.
2. **Living Documentation**: Documentation evolves alongside the codebase.
3. **Decision Records**: Major architectural decisions are documented with context and rationale.
4. **Traceability**: Clear connections between requirements, architectural decisions, and implementations.
5. **Visual Communication**: Diagrams and visual aids to complement textual descriptions.
6. **Lightweight Approach**: Documentation is kept focused and relevant for a personal-use system.

## Revision Tracking

Each document includes a revision history section to track changes over time:

| Version | Date       | Author | Changes                              |
|---------|------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| 0.1     | YYYY-MM-DD | [Name] | Initial draft                        |

## Next Steps

1. Review and refine the existing documentation
2. Begin implementation of Phase 1 features
3. Update documentation as the system evolves
4. Create user guides once the system is functional

## Note on Testing and Validation

For this lightweight, personal-use project, formal testing and validation plans have been intentionally omitted. Testing will be handled through an informal, iterative approach focused on practical utility rather than comprehensive test coverage.
