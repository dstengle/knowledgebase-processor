# Use Case Documentation Plan

This document outlines the plan to integrate core use cases into the project documentation.

**Approved Date:** 2025-05-13

## I. Git Workflow

1.  **Create a new branch**: `feature/define-core-use-cases` (Completed: `refs/heads/feature/define-core-use-cases`)

## II. Goal: Define and Document Core Use Cases

1.  **Create `docs/use-cases.md`**: This will be the new central document detailing the specific questions the system should answer and the types of inferred information it should provide.
    *   **Section: "Target Questions to Answer"**:
        *   List each question provided by the user (e.g., "When was my last meeting with <PERSON>?").
        *   For each question, add a brief description of the desired outcome or information type.
    *   **Section: "Derived or Inferred Information Needs"**:
        *   List each type of derived information (e.g., "Synonyms for titles, tags, and terms").
        *   For each, describe what it means and provide an example.
    *   **Section: "Future Considerations (Out of Current Scope)"**:
        *   Briefly list items like "Processing emails, calendar items, web browsing history, and bookmarks."
        *   State that these are for future evolution and not part of the immediate design enhancements driven by the core use cases.

## III. Goal: Integrate Core Use Cases into Existing Documentation

Once `docs/use-cases.md` is drafted and satisfactory, the following documents will be updated to reference it and align with its content:

1.  **Update `docs/architecture/roadmap/evolution-plan.md`**:
    *   Add a new subsection (e.g., "Core Use Cases" or "Driving Scenarios") that explicitly refers to `docs/use-cases.md`.
    *   Ensure the "Feature Roadmap" and "Success Criteria" for relevant phases/features align with or explicitly mention supporting the use cases detailed in `docs/use-cases.md`.
2.  **Update `docs/architecture/system-overview/data-flow.md`**:
    *   Review the "Metadata Model" to ensure it supports the data requirements implied by `docs/use-cases.md`.
    *   Add a "Conceptual Query Examples" subsection illustrating how use cases might be addressed.
3.  **Update `docs/architecture/system-overview/components.md`**:
    *   Refine "Responsibilities" for `Query Interface`, `Analyzer`, and `Enricher` components to state how they contribute to fulfilling requirements from `docs/use-cases.md`.

## IV. Plan Review & Approval

This overall plan was approved on 2025-05-13. The primary next step is the creation of `docs/use-cases.md`.

## V. Switch Mode for Implementation

After this planning phase (and creation of this plan document), the next step is to switch to a suitable mode (e.g., "Code" mode or a documentation-focused mode if available) to:
1.  Create `docs/use-cases.md`.
2.  Subsequently update the other referenced documents.
