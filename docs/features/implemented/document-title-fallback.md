# Document Title Fallback Mechanism

## Overview

The document title fallback mechanism provides a consistent way to determine document titles in the knowledge base. This feature ensures that every document has a meaningful title, even if one is not explicitly defined in the frontmatter.

## Implementation

The title for a document is determined using the following fallback mechanism:

1. **Primary Source**: Frontmatter title
   - If a document contains frontmatter with a `title` field, this value is used as the document title.

2. **Fallback Source**: Filename
   - If no frontmatter title is available, the filename (minus extension) is used as the document title.
   - Hyphens and underscores in the filename are converted to spaces to create a more readable title.

## Example

Consider a document with the filename `technical-documentation.md`:

### Example 1: With Frontmatter Title

```markdown
---
title: Technical Documentation Guide
author: Documentation Team
---

# Content starts here
```

In this case, the document title will be "Technical Documentation Guide" (from frontmatter).

### Example 2: Without Frontmatter Title

```markdown
---
author: Documentation Team
---

# Content starts here
```

In this case, the document title will be "technical documentation" (from filename).

### Example 3: No Frontmatter

```markdown
# Content starts here
```

In this case, the document title will be "technical documentation" (from filename).

## Usage

The title fallback mechanism is automatically applied during document processing. No additional configuration is required.

## Benefits

- Ensures all documents have meaningful titles
- Provides consistent behavior for title determination
- Simplifies document creation by making the title field optional
- Improves document discoverability and organization
