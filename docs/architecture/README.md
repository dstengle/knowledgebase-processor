# Knowledge Base Processor - Architecture Documentation

This directory contains the architectural documentation for the Knowledge Base Processor project. The documentation is structured to support iterative development while maintaining a clear record of architectural decisions and system evolution.

## Documentation Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Documentation is organized from high-level concepts to detailed specifications.
2. **Living Documentation**: Documentation evolves alongside the codebase.
3. **Decision Records**: Major architectural decisions are documented with context and rationale.
4. **Traceability**: Clear connections between requirements, architectural decisions, and implementations.
5. **Visual Communication**: Diagrams and visual aids to complement textual descriptions.

## Getting Started

1. Start with the [System Overview](./system-overview/context.md) to understand the big picture.
2. Review the [Architectural Principles](./principles/README.md) that guide our design decisions.
3. Explore specific [Components](.md) for detailed specifications.
4. Check the [Architecture Decision Records](./decisions/) to understand why certain approaches were chosen.
