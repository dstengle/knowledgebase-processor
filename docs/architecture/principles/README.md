# Architectural Principles

This document outlines the core principles that guide architectural decisions in the Knowledge Base Processor project. These principles are tailored for a lightweight, personal-use system.

## Core Principles

### 1. Simplicity Over Complexity

The system should prioritize simplicity in both design and implementation. Complex solutions should only be adopted when simpler approaches are inadequate for meeting core requirements.

- Favor straightforward, easy-to-understand designs
- Minimize dependencies and moving parts
- Choose technologies and patterns that are appropriate for personal-scale use

### 2. Pragmatic Metadata Extraction

Focus on extracting metadata that provides immediate, practical value rather than attempting to be comprehensive or perfect.

- Start with the most valuable metadata types
- Use simple, effective extraction techniques
- Prioritize accuracy over completeness

### 3. Iterative Enhancement

Build the system incrementally, with each iteration providing tangible value.

- Begin with a minimal viable solution
- Add capabilities based on actual usage and needs
- Refine existing features before adding new ones

### 4. Personal Workflow Integration

The system should integrate smoothly with personal knowledge management workflows.

- Minimize disruption to existing processes
- Enhance rather than replace current tools
- Support flexible, adaptable usage patterns

### 5. Maintainability

As a personal system, it should be easy to maintain and modify over time.

- Favor clear, well-documented code over clever optimizations
- Design for ease of future modifications
- Minimize technical debt that would impede future changes

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints

- Appropriate for personal computing resources
- Minimal setup and operational overhead
- Sustainable for single-person maintenance

### Scope Constraints

- Focus on personal knowledge management needs
- Avoid features that primarily benefit large-scale or multi-user scenarios
- Prioritize depth (doing a few things well) over breadth

## How to Use These Principles

When making architectural decisions:

1. Review these principles to ensure alignment with the lightweight, personal-use focus
2. Document key decisions with their rationale
3. Regularly revisit and refine these principles based on actual usage experience

These principles should help guide the development of a system that remains useful and maintainable for personal knowledge management without unnecessary complexity.
