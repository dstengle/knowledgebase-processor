## Purpose

The Knowledge Base Processor is a lightweight, personal tool designed to extract structured metadata from an existing knowledge base. Its primary purpose is to enhance the discoverability, organization, and utility of personal knowledge without requiring significant changes to existing content or workflows.

## System Boundaries

### What the System Is

- A metadata extraction and enrichment tool for personal knowledge bases
- A way to generate additional structure from existing content
- A bridge between unstructured notes and structured knowledge
- A personal utility that runs on demand or on a schedule

### What the System Is Not

- A replacement for existing knowledge management tools
- A content creation or editing platform
- A multi-user or enterprise knowledge management system
- A real-time processing system requiring high availability

## Users and Stakeholders

As a personal system, the primary user and stakeholder is the individual knowledge base owner. The system serves their needs for better organization, retrieval, and insights from their personal knowledge collection.

## External Systems

The Knowledge Base Processor interacts with:

1. **Source Knowledge Base**
   - Provides the raw content for processing
   - May be files in a directory, a specific application's data store, or other formats
   - Read-only access is preferred to minimize risk

2. **Metadata Store**
   - Stores the extracted and derived metadata
   - May be separate from or integrated with the source knowledge base
   - Should be in a format that's easily queryable for personal use

3. **Optional Integration Points**
   - Search tools that can leverage the enhanced metadata
   - Visualization tools for knowledge graphs or concept maps
   - Other personal productivity tools that can benefit from structured metadata

## Key Interactions

1. **Content Extraction**
   - The system reads content from the knowledge base
   - This should be non-destructive and respect the original content

2. **Metadata Processing**
   - Content is analyzed to extract and derive metadata
   - This may include topics, entities, relationships, etc.

3. **Metadata Storage**
   - Processed metadata is stored in a structured format
   - The storage should be accessible for personal use cases

4. **Metadata Utilization**
   - The enhanced metadata enables improved search, navigation, and insights
   - This may be through direct queries or through integration with other tools

## Constraints

- Must operate within the resource constraints of personal computing environments
- Should minimize setup and maintenance overhead
- Must respect the integrity of the original knowledge base
- Should provide value even with partial processing or incomplete metadata

## Success Criteria

The system will be successful if it:

1. Extracts useful metadata that wasn't explicitly defined in the original content
2. Enhances the user's ability to find and connect information in their knowledge base
3. Integrates smoothly with existing personal knowledge management workflows
4. Requires minimal ongoing maintenance
5. Provides clear value that justifies its existence as a personal tool
