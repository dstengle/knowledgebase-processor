# ADR-0002: Pydantic for Data Models

**Date:** 2025-05-03

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The Knowledge Base Processor needs to define, validate, and manipulate structured data models for:
- Representing markdown document structure
- Storing extracted metadata
- Ensuring data consistency and integrity
- Serializing/deserializing data to/from JSON

As a Python-based system (per ADR-0001), we need an approach to data modeling that provides:
- Type safety and validation
- Clear, self-documenting code
- Efficient serialization/deserialization
- Support for complex nested structures
- Easy integration with Python's type hinting system

## Decision

We will use Pydantic as the library for defining and validating data models in the Knowledge Base Processor.

## Rationale

Pydantic offers several advantages that align well with our project needs:

1. **Type Safety with Python Type Annotations**: Pydantic leverages Python's type hinting system to provide runtime type checking and validation, enhancing code reliability without sacrificing Python's flexibility.

2. **Data Validation**: Pydantic automatically validates data during model instantiation, ensuring that the data conforms to the expected structure and types.

3. **JSON Schema Generation**: Pydantic can automatically generate JSON schemas from models, which is useful for documentation and potential API development.

4. **Serialization/Deserialization**: Pydantic provides built-in methods for converting between Python objects and JSON, which is essential for storing and retrieving metadata.

5. **Nested Models**: Pydantic supports complex nested data structures, which will be necessary for representing hierarchical markdown content.

6. **Self-Documenting Code**: Models defined with Pydantic are clear and self-documenting, improving maintainability.

7. **Integration with Python Ecosystem**: Pydantic works well with other Python libraries and frameworks, maintaining our ability to leverage Python's ecosystem.

## Alternatives Considered

### Dataclasses (Standard Library)
- **Pros**: Built into Python, no additional dependencies, good IDE support
- **Cons**: Limited validation capabilities, requires additional libraries for JSON serialization
- **Reason not chosen**: Pydantic offers more comprehensive validation and serialization features

### attrs
- **Pros**: Mature library, flexible, good performance
- **Cons**: Less focused on data validation, more complex API
- **Reason not chosen**: Pydantic's focus on validation and simpler API better matches our needs

### marshmallow
- **Pros**: Powerful serialization/deserialization, good validation
- **Cons**: Separate schema definitions from class definitions, more verbose
- **Reason not chosen**: Pydantic's integration of schema with class definition is more intuitive

### Custom Classes
- **Pros**: Maximum flexibility, no dependencies
- **Cons**: Requires writing and maintaining validation, serialization, and other boilerplate code
- **Reason not chosen**: Reinventing functionality that Pydantic provides would be inefficient

## Consequences

### Positive
- Reduced boilerplate code for data validation and serialization
- Improved code reliability through runtime type checking
- Clear, self-documenting data models
- Simplified JSON handling

### Negative
- Additional dependency on Pydantic
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Pydantic
- Slight runtime overhead for validation

### Neutral
- Will influence the structure of our data models
- May affect how we approach certain data transformations

## Implementation Approach

We will define Pydantic models for key data structures including:

1. **Document Model**: Representing a markdown document with metadata
   ```python
   class Document(BaseModel):
       id: str
       path: str
       created: Optional[datetime] = None
       modified: Optional[datetime] = None
       content: str
       elements: List["Element"]
   ```

2. **Element Model**: Base model for structural elements
   ```python
   class Element(BaseModel):
       id: str
       type: ElementType
       parent_id: Optional[str] = None
       position: Position
       content: str
   ```

3. **Specialized Elements**: Extended models for specific element types
   ```python
   class HeadingElement(Element):
       level: int
       text: str
   
   class TodoElement(Element):
       completed: bool
       text: str
   ```

## Related Decisions

This decision builds on:
- [ADR-0001: Python as Implementation Language](0001-python-as-implementation-language.md)

This decision will influence:
- Data storage approach
- API design (if applicable)
- Testing strategy for data models

## Notes

- We will use Pydantic v2.x for improved performance
- We will leverage Pydantic's JSON schema generation for documentation
- Custom validators will be used where necessary for complex validation rules
