## ADR-0000: Template for Architecture Decision Records

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context

Describe the context and problem statement that led to this decision. What forces are at play? What constraints exist? What goals are we trying to achieve?

For a personal knowledge base processor, this might include:
- Current limitations in your knowledge management workflow
- Specific metadata needs that aren't being met
- Technical constraints of your personal computing environment

## Decision

Clearly state the architecture decision that was made. Be specific and concise.

Example:
"We will use a plugin-based architecture for metadata extractors to allow for easy addition of new extraction techniques without modifying the core system."

## Rationale

Explain why this particular decision was made over alternatives. Connect the decision back to the architectural principles and the specific context.

- How does this decision support the principle of simplicity?
- How does it enable iterative enhancement?
- How does it integrate with your personal workflow?

## Alternatives Considered

What other options were considered? Why weren't they chosen? This helps future readers understand the full decision-making process.

For each alternative:
- Briefly describe the approach
- Note its advantages
- Explain why it wasn't selected

## Consequences

Describe the resulting context after applying the decision. Include both positive and negative consequences.

- What becomes easier or possible?
- What becomes more difficult?
- What trade-offs were accepted?

## Related Decisions

List any related decisions that influenced this one or that are influenced by this one.

## Notes

Any additional information that might be helpful to future readers.
