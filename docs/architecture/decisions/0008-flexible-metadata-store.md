# ADR-0008: Flexible Metadata Store System

**Date:** 2025-05-15

**Status:** Proposed

## Context

The knowledge base processor requires a metadata store system that can adapt to diverse use cases and data models. Current limitations in metadata storage include a lack of flexibility to support various storage backends, such as JSON files, graph databases, RDF, or SPARQL endpoints. This inflexibility hinders the ability to meet evolving requirements, such as:

- Storing hierarchical or graph-based relationships.
- Supporting semantic queries using RDF or SPARQL.
- Handling lightweight, file-based metadata storage for simpler use cases.

The goal is to design a system that accommodates these diverse needs while maintaining extensibility and scalability.

## Decision

We will implement a flexible metadata store system that supports multiple storage backends, including but not limited to JSON, graph databases, RDF, and SPARQL. The system will use an abstraction layer to decouple the core logic from specific storage implementations, enabling seamless integration of new backends as needed.

### Interface Contract

A formal interface contract for the metadata store abstraction will be defined in [`docs/architecture/components/metadata-store-interface.md`](../components/metadata-store-interface.md). This contract will specify:
- Required CRUD and query methods, with type signatures.
- Error handling via custom exception classes and documented failure modes.
- Extensibility points, such as hooks for pre/post-processing and support for backend-specific extensions.

All backend implementations must conform to this interface. The interface will be versioned to support future evolution.

### Backend Integration Mechanisms

- **Plugin Pattern:** New backend implementations will be integrated using a plugin pattern. Each backend registers itself with a central registry at import time.
- **Discovery:** The system will discover available backends via entry points or a registry mechanism, allowing dynamic loading.
- **Registration:** Backend classes must register a unique backend type string and provide a factory for instantiation.
- **Extensibility:** Adding a new backend requires implementing the interface and registering with the plugin system; no core code changes are needed.

See the detailed specification in [`metadata-store-interface.md`](../components/metadata-store-interface.md).

### Configuration Format and Runtime Selection

- **Format:** The backend and its configuration will be specified in the configuration file used by the processor .
- **Validation:** All configuration and schema validation will use Pydantic, as established in [ADR-0002](0002-pydantic-for-data-models.md). This ensures type safety, clear error reporting, and consistency across the system.
- **Runtime Selection:** The backend type is selected at runtime based on the configuration. Environment variables or CLI arguments may override the config file for advanced use cases.

### Dependency Injection Approach

- **Pattern:** Constructor injection will be used to provide the selected metadata store implementation to system components.
- **Framework:** The system may use a DI library such as [`dependency-injector`](https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/) for wiring dependencies, or a simple provider/factory pattern if requirements remain minimal.
- **Wiring:** DI is configured at application startup, reading the configuration and instantiating the appropriate backend.

### Schema Validation, Migration, Testing, and Versioning

- **Schema Validation:** All metadata and configuration will be validated using Pydantic models before storage or use. Backend-specific validation may be layered as needed.
- **Migration:** Schema versions will be tracked in metadata. Migration scripts or routines will be provided to upgrade data between versions.
- **Testing:** An abstract test suite will be defined to verify all backend implementations for correctness and compliance. Each backend must pass these tests.
- **Versioning:** The interface and data schema will be versioned. Backends must declare supported versions and handle migrations as needed.

### Detailed Design Reference

The full interface contract, backend plugin specification, and example implementations are documented in [`docs/architecture/components/metadata-store-interface.md`](../components/metadata-store-interface.md). This ADR will be updated to reference future changes in that document.

## Rationale

This decision aligns with the following principles:

- **Extensibility:** By abstracting the storage layer, we can add support for new backends without modifying the core system.
- **Scalability:** Different backends can be chosen based on the scale and complexity of the metadata, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Flexibility:** Users can select the most appropriate storage backend for their specific use case, enhancing the system's adaptability.
- **Consistency:** Using Pydantic for all validation and schema enforcement ensures a unified approach, as established in ADR-0002.

Alternatives, such as committing to a single storage backend, were considered but rejected due to their inability to meet the diverse requirements outlined above.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Single Backend Approach:**
   - **Advantages:** Simplicity in implementation and maintenance.
   - **Disadvantages:** Limited flexibility and scalability, making it unsuitable for diverse use cases.

2. **Custom Storage Format:**
   - **Advantages:** Tailored to specific needs of the knowledge base processor.
   - **Disadvantages:** High development and maintenance costs, with limited interoperability.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- Enables support for a wide range of use cases, from simple file-based storage to complex semantic queries.
- Future-proofs the system by allowing easy integration of emerging storage technologies.
- Improves user satisfaction by offering customizable storage options.
- Maintains consistency and reliability by standardizing on Pydantic for validation.

### Negative Consequences

- Increased complexity in the initial implementation due to the need for an abstraction layer.
- Potential overhead in maintaining compatibility with multiple backends.

## Notes

- The detailed interface contract and backend plugin specification are maintained in [`docs/architecture/components/metadata-store-interface.md`](../components/metadata-store-interface.md).
- This decision will require updates to the system's architecture documentation and testing framework to ensure compatibility with multiple backends.
